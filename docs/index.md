# EEEE

EEEE* is a tiny framework for simple console input of values and generation of objects, which I
wrote mainly for exercises of the university, because here often simple inputs with a scanner are
needed, and I did not want to rewrite them again and again.

Also, I didn't use any existing frameworks, ~~because apparently we are only allowed to use
self-written code in the exams, and so I am allowed to use this mini-framework in the exams~~.

**EDIT:** Looks like all frameworks are allowed. Well shit.

**NOTE:** This framework is ab-so-lutely not suitable for production use. It should only serve for
practice. Also, definitely not type-safe.

Below, you can find some quick starts for each module.

*) To be honest, I've already forgotten the meaning of the abbreviation. But it was certainly
perfect!
